Kavir landscape planning <br>
Landscape Design studio 1 | 2018 <br>

The Kavir Biosphere Reserve is located in the Anatolian Iranian Desert. The Kavir plain is composed mainly of flood plains and low mountain ranges. The reserve is characterized by salt and sandy lands with arid and semi-arid desert vegetation, and is inhabited by steppe communities (unesco.org).
The road that takes us to Bahram Palace is an absolute attraction in the heart of this infinite desert. The stone-paved road was known as the royal paving. In Safavid times, there was a highway in the middle of the desert to guide travelers safely from one side of the desert to the other. A highway connecting several desert cities. Some believe that Shah Abbas, who intended to travel between Mazandaran and Isfahan, built this caravanserai in this area so he could rest in the middle of the road. Others have gone further and believe that the building belongs to Bahram from the Sassanid dynasty. Some water canals can still be seen outside and inside the caravanserai. Water flow moved through two passages. One was the clay pipes that laid underground, and the other was the stone canals that are still clearly visible on the ground.


36-hour plan to explore the Kavir of Iran, stay overnight at Qasre-Bahram caravanserai and explore the Kavir site the next days. visitors aim to discover Kavir nature during their journey and in addition to recognizing the visual and environmental elements, to start a journey inside themselves. Reaching the meaning of nothingness from two perspectives: one, decadence and ultimately become nothing and union with nature, and from another perspective, the opposite meaning of "all" refers to a look beyond, a more general look at the category of existence itself.
